# Semantic Artwork Clustering
My thesis project on **clustering of deep semantic embeddings** of artworks from the *ArtGraph* dataset. The semantic embeddings are obtained from the **OpenAI CLIP** image and text encoders, i.e. the vision and text Transformers, specifically finetuned for the purpose with data from *ArtGraph*. The clusters found are then interpreted, describing them in terms of genre, topic, media, etc.
